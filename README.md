# EMG-signal-analysis

A large dataset of EMG signals was taken from healthy people of varying ages. 
I extracted five features from every signal to fit in a regression curve. 
The regression curve was made using MATLAB in-built regression curve fitting application.
This curve would be a normalcy curve with respect to which the other EMG signals would be measured and quantify the fatigue. 
This can be used to predict muscle related problems early.
